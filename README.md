# EC - Immigrant Insertion in Evolutionary Algorithms

<br>

## Description
Implementation and analysis of different immigrant insertion techniques in an evolutionary algorithm, tested with different benchmark problems, in order to draw conclusions about changes in performance.

### Technologies:
- Python

<br>

## Information

Test parametrization: Run parameter_testing.py

Test and compare 3 algorithms (SEA default, SEA with random immigrants insertion and SEA with elitist immigrants insertion): Run immigrant_insertion_testing.py

Apply statistical tests: Run statistical_analysis.py

All the images and values are stored in directory: /output

The most import values used in the report are in directory: /output/report

### Note
Several parts of the code were adapted and modified from the files given by Professor Ernesto Costa in classes.
